# Introduction

## Recap

Our main goal:

> To make our research as reproducable and visible as possible

This entails:

1. Sharing of code
2. Sharing of data (if possible and not proprietary nor privacy sensitive)
3. Sharing of output (presentation, article, website)

## The power of plain text

1.  Ubiquitous
2.  Usually small in size 
3.  Portable across platforms (and versions)
    + it will not be obsolete soon
    + *everyone* can read it *everywhere*
4.  It is scriptable (both as input as output)
    - code is almost **always** in text format
    - **usually** data is in text format as well
    - but underlying format for output (presentation, website, tables, articles, books) **can** be text as well
    
## Manipulation of text

- Most output is based on simple text file; applications only change appearance, such as:
    - browsers
    - pdf
    
- **How** to change appearance require markup-languages
    - `HTML`
    - `LaTeX`
    - `Markdown`

# Markdown

## Why markdown?

1. Easy to learn [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2. Much less notation than LaTeX. Originally, 

    + `LaTeX` is for paper (aka dead trees)
    + `Markdown` is for `HTML` (blogs, wikipedia and so)
    + but sneakily uses some LaTeX when needed
3. Focus on text
4. Nowadays:

    + "easily" change it in `html` or `pdf` (via LaTeX)---even in Word's `.docx` if needed (but error prone)
    + can be extended with code (verbatim) or---even better---its results

## Small diversion

> Question 1: Why and when do we make use of `pdf`'s and not `html`?

> Question 2: Is one always better than the other?

## Language syntax 

Emphasis:
```markdown
*italic* **bold**
_italic_ __bold__
```

Headers:
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Unordened lists
```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
```

Ordered List
```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
```

```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Code blocks:

```markdown

    ```python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
    ```
    
```

which renders as:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

To embed mathematics 'just' use LaTeX ([see **here** for list of symbols](https://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/LaTeX_symbols.pdf) and note that LaTeX should be installed on your computer):

```markdown
$$e=mc^2$$
```

which surprisingly looks as excel type of formulae and renders as:

$$e=mc^2$$

## Language syntax (cont.)

Inline equations just require `$ $`, e.g.: 

```Latex
In economics it is well known that: 
$\frac{d x}{d y} = -\frac{
\partial u(x,y)/ \partial y} {
\partial u(x,y)/ \partial x}$.
```

which renders as

In economics it is well known that: $\frac{d x}{d y} = -\frac{
\partial u(x,y)/
\partial y} {
\partial u(x,y)/
\partial x}$.

# Pandoc

## The swiss knife of formats

So how do we glue everything together and produce wonderful `html`s and `pdf`s out of thin air? With **[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)**

+ Pandoc can convert from (not extensive):

    + `Markdown` (whoohoo), `LaTeX`, `HTML`, `DocBook`, `Org`-mode, and ... Words `docx` (sort off)
+ To (and here we go...)

    + HTML formats (including those very cool and nerdy HTML(5) slides)
    + via Latex to pdf
    + Word (but support somewhat limited) and OpenOffice formats
    + various markup formats
    + and much more

# The Assignment


## The assignment

- if not already done do:

    - clone ```thdegraaff/ERSA-WooW``` and save it locally

- go to the folder ```./Assignments/```

- Open `Assignment1.md` in `RStudio`

- and transform `Assignment1.md` *as much as possible* in `RStudio`: 

    - This means adding Markdown tags to the basic text
    - The file [HowToWriteAShinyPaperLimited](../doc/HowToWriteAShinyPaperLimited.pdf) provides a `LaTeX` example how the format sort of should be.
    
- Save it with the same name.
