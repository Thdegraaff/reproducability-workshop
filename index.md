## {{site.data.course.name}}

This is the workshop website for **{{site.data.course.number}}**: the
{{site.data.course.name}} to be held in January 2019.

### Introduction

Did you ever:

- want to use your text both for papers and websites or blogs;
- feel constrained by Microsoft's `Word` (but hesitate to adopt `LaTeX`);
- want to go back to a previous version of the text but accidentally deleted it or argue with co-authors which document version was
actually the latest;
- think that it would be nice (and very efficient) if you could easily share and access background material- of papers, workshops or lectures?

But did not know how to start with this, then this workshop might be
of interest to you.

### Aim of the workshop

To get master students familiar with `Markdown`, the versioning
system `Git` and using open repositories, in particular `GitHub`.

From a wider perspective, these type of tools serve brilliantly to
make your research as reproducable as possible, because (*i*)
`Markdown` can be read by anyone because it is just plain text, (*ii*)
`Git` allows you to go back in time for your research so that you can
always trace back what the **past you** have done and (*iii*) `Github`
provides easy access for others to see what both **you** and the
**past you** have done.

### What?

It focuses on using a very simple markup language (`Markdown`) and its
interaction with one of the major open repositories
`GitHub`. Typically, `Markdown` is used for blogging but can as well
be used for writing papers, as the `Markdown` syntax can very easily
be transformed in `HTML` or `LaTeX` files (or to the open office
format if needed). To do so, we use the `RStudio` application, which
is probably one of the applications easiest to use *out of the box*
and where the conversion between formats is done automatically *under
the hood*. Note that this workshop does not deal with using `R` or
literate programming (weaving text and code with, e.g., `R`'s `Knitr`
package).

Moreover, we will deal with the versioning system `Git` in combination
with the `GitHub` open repository platform. We do not aim to give all
details of `Git` or using `Git` from the command line, instead we will
use a desktop application with a graphical user interface with serves
best as a first gentle introduction of both `Git` and `Github`.

### Contents?

This workshop includes a hands-on overview of specific tools that have
been designed with open science and reproducibility principles in
mind. This is delivered alternating presentation time with demo time,
allowing participants to get a real taste of what using the tools
implies and see live their advantages.

In more detail, the workshop is structured as follows:

1. Introduction to reproducibility and open science workflow
principles (30 mins.)  2. `Markdown` language (45 mins.)
3. Principles behind `Git` and workflow examples (60 mins.)
4. Publication of your materials on the open repository `GitHub`
(45. mins).
