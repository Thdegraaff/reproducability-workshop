title: Introduction
---

In this 20 minutes session we introduce the concepts of workflow, openness and reproducability. In the first part, We argue why they are important and what as social scientists we can learn from data scientists. Our main argument is that, even though in the social sciences complete reproducability is often infeasible, we should strive for research to become *as reproducable* as possible.

In the second part we lay out the road-map for the rest of the workshop. Most importantly, we explain why in this workshop we make use a set of particular tools, namely: 

1. the `Markdown` language;
2. `Git`;
3. and`GitHub`

Note that We are aware that using a particular data analysis tool is costly in terms of time investment and is ideosyncratic in terms of preferences and needs. Therefore, we strongly support the underlying concepts and not so much specific tools or applications. However, in this workshop we decided to make use of the  `RStudio` application for two main reasons: (*i*) it works the best **out of the box** for *our* purposes and (*ii*) at the moment most researchers probably work with this combination for reproducability (at least it gets the biggest buzz...)

### Outcomes

After this session you should:

* understand why a reproducable and open workflow is important for you and the scientific community;
* have an overview of some suitable (open source) tools available;
* have insight how some of these tools are related to each other;
* and be able to install these tools
