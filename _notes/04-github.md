title: Github
---

In this 45 min. session we look at the `GitHub` open repository. Although there are others as well that could interact with `Git` (e.g., `BitBucket`). But `Github` is definitely the largest and best known at the moment. 

Where `Git` functions as a versioning system, `GitHub` acts both as a backup system and as a platform for collaboration. In that sense, it has similar features as `Dropbox`. There are some noteworthy differences though. 
* With `Github` scholars can work on the same project at the same time and later merge their contributions
* `Github` is per default open. Your `Github` account in that sense is more alike to a `LinkedIn` profile than to something as `Dropbox`.
* `GitHub` and `Markdown` is a killer combination. Because `GitHub` can hosts all kinds of code and text, it can just as well hosts static websites. In fact, this whole workshop website is a `Github` repository.

Typically, it is best to see `GitHub` as an open repository, which makes it ideal to share:
* background material (appendices, code, tables) for articles;
* educational material for classes;
* ideas, as in blogs or general websites.

### Requirements

The tool which we will play to explore these ideas practically are [`GitHub`](http://www.github.com) and its graphical user interface from `GitHub`: [`GitHub Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com/). 

Moreover, you only need a valid `GitHub` account (see assignment 1).

### Outcomes


This session will provide you with the following skills:

* an understanding of how `GitHub` works and how valuable it could be for your own work;
* be able to push and pull your material to your repository;
* to copy (clone) your or somebody's else repository;
* to create a website from your repository, and
* do all this (much simpler) with GitHub desktop.
