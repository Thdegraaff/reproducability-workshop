title: Version control 
---

In this 1h. session we introduce the concepts of version control. This relates to keeping track of changes as they occur throughout the process or research and writing. 

### Requirements

The tool which we will play to explore these ideas practically are [`git`](http://www.git-scm.com) and its graphical user interface from `GitHub`: [`GitHub Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Outcomes

This session will provide you with the following skills:

* An understanding of what version control is and why it is important to include it in your workflow
* Enough knowledge of `git`, as a particular version control software, to be able to:
    * Initiate a project
    * Track changes as you work
    * Examine the history of changes you have made to the project
    * Compare different versions
    * Revert to previous versions of a file
    * Ignore some files inside a project folder
* Do all this (much simpler) with GitHub desktop
