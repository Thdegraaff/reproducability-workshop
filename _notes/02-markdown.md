title: "Markdown"
---

In this 45 minutes session we introduce the concept of markup languages in combination with pandoc and working with the terminal. In particular we focus on markdown: a very lightweight and markup language (and probably the fastest way to create slides). In particular we deal with:

1. `Markdown`
2. `Pandoc`
3. `Rstudio`

Although the second one, pandoc, is not completely necessary (it is under the hood of `RStudio`), we think it is important and handy enough to spend some attention to. 

### Requirements

For this session, we basically need only one tool: `RStudio`.  

For the assignment we will partly replicate [this paper](../doc/HowToWriteAShinyPaper.pdf). The basic (unstructured) document for the assignment is [here](../Assignments/Assignment1.zip) (in .zip format).

### Outcomes

After this session you should:

* understand the basic command of the markdown language;
* be able to write a (part of a) paper in markdown in RStudio including:
	* headers;
	* links;
	* formula's;
	* lists;
	* figures.
* be able to export this to:
	* `HTML` export; 
	* `pdf` export;
	* Words' `docx` export.
